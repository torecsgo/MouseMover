2. Run the program with `java`.
3. Click the "Start" button to begin moving the mouse.
4. Click the "Cancel" button to stop the mouse movement.

## Example Execution

Upon starting the program, you will see a window with two buttons and a label. When you click "Start," the mouse will begin moving to random positions on the screen every 5 seconds, and the label will display the current mouse coordinates. You can stop the movement by clicking "Cancel."
